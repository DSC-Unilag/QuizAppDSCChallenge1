# QuizAppDSCChallenge1

The BioQuiz app is a quiz app, with 10 questions on basic biology. At the end of the quiz, a toast message showing your score appears.

The challenge wraps up, and I've been able to build a beautiful quiz app, in the process learnig about sharedPreferences, activity lifecycle, started using version control among others. It was awesome from Day1, thanks to the DSC Unilag mentors. Learned everyday, and developing an app successfully without following any tutorial makes me feel like some professional developer. It was full of unexplainable bugs and crashes, but thanks to google and the DSC Unilag mentors, for coming through. We move!
